It also includes an ES modules build that works well with Rollup and Webpack2's tree-shaking.UMD build exports a global called window.ReduxActions if you add it to your page via a <script> tag. We don’t recommend UMD builds for any serious application, as most of the libraries complementary to Redux are only available on npm."
